# Privacy Policy for Safe Link Checker

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14

**Safe Link Checker** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information.**

*   **No Personal Data:** We do not collect your name, email address, IP address, or any other personally identifiable information.
*   **No Browsing History:** We do not track or store your browsing history.
*   **Local Processing:** All link analysis is performed locally within your browser or by fetching the public content of the link you explicitly click on. No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers for analysis.

## 2. Permissions Usage

The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly. These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the link checking service:

*   **Host Permissions (`*://*.google.com/*`, etc.):** Required to detect links on Google search result pages and to fetch the content of the links you choose to check.
*   **Scripting & ActiveTab:** Used to insert the "Safety Check" buttons and display analysis results directly on the web page you are viewing.
*   **Storage:** Used to save your preference for enabling/disabling the extension locally on your device.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.
