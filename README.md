# Safe Link Checker

**Safe Link Checker** is a Chrome extension that checks if links on websites you visit are safe. It aims to protect users from potential threats such as phishing, malware, and scam sites.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Link Analysis:** Adds a "Safety Check" button next to each link on Google search result pages, analyzing the safety of the link immediately upon clicking.
*   **Comprehensive Safety Assessment:** Evaluates the safety score of a link based on various criteria, including:
    *   Usage of secure protocol (HTTPS)
    *   Inclusion of high-risk domain extensions (TLDs)
    *   Usage of URL shortening services
    *   Length and structural characteristics of the URL
    *   Presence of phishing-related keywords within the page
*   **Intuitive Results:** Analysis results are clearly displayed in three levels: "Safe", "Caution", and "Risky". If a link is deemed risky or requires caution, specific reasons are provided.

## How to Use

1.  Install the **Safe Link Checker** extension.
2.  Go to a Google search results page. You will see a **"Safety Check"** button next to the title of each search result.
3.  Click the "Safety Check" button for the link you are curious about. The button will change to show the analysis result (e.g., "Safe", "Caution", "Risky").
4.  If the result is "Caution" or "Risky", hover your mouse over the **"Reason"** button that appears next to it to see the detailed reason for the analysis.

## Disclaimer

*   This extension is an auxiliary tool to help judge the potential risk of links and cannot guarantee 100% detection of all types of threats.
*   Please refrain from visiting links with low safety scores and be especially careful not to enter personal or financial information.
